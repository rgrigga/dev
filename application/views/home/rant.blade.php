<h2>Target Market</h2>
        We aim to serve:
        	<ul>
        		<li>Small Businesses</li>
        		<li>The Customers of our Small Businesses</li>
        		<li>The General Public</li>
        		<p>Our target market for Phase 1 is small business, but Phase 2 may quickly include a larger scope of use, possibly in ways we do not yet understand.</p>
        	</ul>

		<h2>Who are the users?</h2>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Business Owners</li>
        		<li>Core Staff</li>
        		<li>Management</li>
        		<li>Consumers</li>
        	</ul>

		<h2>Apps are expensive!</h2>
		<p>Small businesses are often limited by time, budget, and knowhow.  This process can change that.  A small business can use one of our boilerplate templates to get basic functionality quickly and easily.  If we don't have a template available, we will build it, improving our code-base in the process.</p>
		<p>A small business can have their own website, rich with content and functionality like twitter, facebook, etc. Some businesses may want this finctionality, but they are not able to afford it, don't have the time to set it up...</p>

			<p>Same for customers... people have to spend time and energy setting all those sites up... it takes forever.  Well, we can simplify that for you.  After you set a few username - password combinations, you can decide what you want your username to be.  Tell me: Migrate email. (PS: this mimics a simplified CLI.  php artisan install blah blah.  how about 'install artisan'.  I found a tutorial on how to do that.). anyway, the next thing to do is pick which one you want people to see first.  That way, you can decide what you want people to see first.  </p>

		<h3>But can't a client just set this up on their own?</h3>
		Yes.  You can do your own dental work, too, but is that a good idea?  



		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>This project aims to keep simple architecture designed around modular components.  This model is not new, but this implementation is, as far as i can tell.  Current development tools include:
        	<ul>
        		<li>PHP, Laravel, Blade</li>
        		these are server side applications, is there a better way?  If you think so, please explain why in great detail!
        		<li>jquery and jquery mobile</li>
        		jquery mobile very light and user-friendly. My kids could do it. and they should.
        		<li>Wordpress</li>
        		i prefer due to a user-friendly design, flexibility, mobile-compatibility, and my own familiarness.  

        		<li>Facebook API</li>
        		<li>Twitter API</li>
        		<li>Linked In API</li>
        		<li>Linux</li>
        		worthy of longer discussion
        	</ul>	

        	future elements may include:
        	<ul>
        		<li>bundles:img/inkscape/gimp/illustrator, etc.</li>
        		<li>bundles:db?/git/svn/etc</li>
        		<li>DB::linux/LAMP</li>
        		<li>route->DB->SQLite/MySQL/Redis</li>

We hope people will edit it.  Think of our company policy, and the entire product, and business model itself, is like a giant wiki.  Anyone with the correct experience.
