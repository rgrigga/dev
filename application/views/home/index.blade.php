            <h1>MyApp</h1>
            <h2>Your Own App</h2>
            <p>MyApp is your own web app.  It has been built from the core.  It is the result of computing knowledge on thousands of years of developer experience.  Once set up, you can use it on any device you own.  There is nothing for the end-user to buy, download, or install.  Use it on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="img/mobile/png/iphone5.png"> smartphone (iphone/android)</li>
                <li>tablet (ipod/kindle/other) <img src="img/mobile/png/ipad.png"></li>
                <li>desktop/laptop pc</li>
                <li>any other device with a web browser</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/device-icons.png" alt="MyApp!" />

            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>Alot. The last time you bought a new device, you probably spent at least a few hours re-setting up your contacts, favorites, apps, facebook, twitter, etc... MyApp gives you a way to centralize all of this and take it with you.</p>
            <p>Once your app is set up, all you have to do is visit myapp.com/you or you.myapp.com from any device, and Presto! You'll have access to all of your favorite content from all kinds of other services:
                <ul>
                    <li>Email</li>
                    <li>Text Message</li>
                    <li>Chat/IM</li>
                    <li>Fax</li>
                    <li>Twitter Stream</li>
                    <li>Facebook Stream</li>
                    <li>Contacts</li>
                    <li>Documents</li>
                    <li>Links/Favorites</li>
                    <li>Photos*</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h3>Yes, but is it simple?</h3>
        <p>In programming terms, MyApp seeks to abstract the physical user as an object, and simplify the implemetation of that object from other parts of "the system".  Our goal is to automate as much of the relationship between "user" and as many of the other systems as possible.</p>

        <h3>What do you do?</h3>

            <h3>Focused on Simple Functions</h3>
            <p>In layman terms: technology is complicated.  Have you ever thought to yourself, "I want what I want, not what they think I want."?</p>
            <p>MySearch allows you to browse ads and content the way <i>you</i> want to.  It can automagically catalogue add your favorites: links, web history, contacts, and content from other sources (twitter, facebook, etc).  Search ebay, amazon, then add all of your favorites and contacts to find what you want to find.</p>

            <h3>Flexible</h3>
            <p>Do you prefer to intereact directly with fb, t, li, etc.? Push and pull profile info, settings, favorites, etc. to and from these and other popular services at any time.</p>
            <p>MyApp is secure!  We invest much of our time reviewing and implementing security best-practices. -learn more-</p>

            <h3>So Much More</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Group sharing allows simple yet powerful tools that will wow your clients, contacts, and so on.</li>
                <li>Your dashboard is highly customizable and easy to use. You can do as much or as little of the customization as you can handle.  If you make improvements, you can earn stock in the company.  And/or, you can hire one of our people (or one of your people) to work on the project.</li>
                <li>UniSearch allows you to search everything at once.</li>
                <li>MyApp is built on laravel, a php framework.  Laravel uses <i>bundles</i>, which allow us to add and remove features at will.  Your App can integrate popular features and functionality of any of the following applications, plus lots of other stuff we haven't thought of yet:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="img/icon/png/social/social_facebook.png" alt="Facebook" />Facebook</li>
                    <li><img src="img/icon/png/social/social_twitter_bird.png" alt="Twitter" />Twitter</li>
                    <li><img src="img/icon/png/social/social_linked_in.png" alt="LinkedIn" />LinkedIn</li>
                    <li>Skype</li>
                    <li>google docs</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
            </em></p>
